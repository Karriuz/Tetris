# Tetris

Javascript tetris game created created in my early days of learning js. Code here is kinda ugly and unreadable, and today I would definitely be able to create it in much better and simpler way. 
I used animejs lib to animate graphic in the background.

## Scoreboard

In order to make scoreboard work, app uses very simple express backend which connects to the mongoDB database. 

## Live
