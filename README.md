Javascript tetris-like game with "backend" scoreboard made via express.js and linked to mongoDB. 
I decided to publish only client-side code here, API is just template copied from random tutorial.

Main issue at this moment is possibility to make fetch calls by basically anyone with javascript, and ugly as hell UI sidepanel.
